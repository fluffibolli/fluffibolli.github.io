              We have taken into consideration all the existing products
              which could solve the issue of making sustainable
              toilets for developing countries,
              for example porta loos.
              However, our market research has shown that our
              product - REPEET – offers something unique
              and that there is a real demand for our product.
            </p>
            <p>
              Primarily, because we have aimed our product at
              LICs, the product would have to be affordable.
              REPEET toilets are only made of plastic
              (main body, tripod, pipes) and cardboard
              (disposable boxes for waste) resulting
              in them having a very light mass which
              means cheaper shipping costs.
              It would cost a lot more money shipping porta loos
              to Bangladesh or Syria, for example,
              than it would to ship REPEET toilets there.
              This makes REPEET toilets a better choice than
              many other solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another reason REPEET toilets are the most practical
              solution to the problem of un-sustainable sewage
              systems in many countries,
              is that instead of just using them for one use,
              you can in fact use REPEET toilets for three
              different uses: toilets, soil and showering/clean
              water.

              This actually makes this product not just a solution
              in providing people with a place to relieve themselves
              but a place to wash instead of the river and
              a way to produce fertile soil which in turn will
              help to grow food. It is also all recyclable!
            </p>
            <p>
              In the conditions of people pooing and weeing in
              holes in the ground, then pouring it into the
              river and then drinking and washing in that
              same river water, there are high chances of
              getting infections which can then lead to diseases.
              By introducing the REPEET sewage system it will
              reduce the chances of infections by a great
              percentage which will make whole areas safer,
              more hygienic and nicer to live in.
              We are also hoping that making private areas
              for people to ‘do their business’ will help girls
              feel more secure and less vulnerable to
              sexual predators.
            </p>
            <p>
              REPEET sewage system will help these LIC’s
              develop and help the people live a happier,
              cleaner and safer life.
              It will provide them with private places to go
              to the toilet, growing spaces and showers.
              REPEET toilets will ensure that infections
              and diseases will be reduced areas will
              be nicer places to be in.

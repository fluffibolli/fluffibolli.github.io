                      WHY REPEET?

                      We have taken into consideration all the existing products which could solve the issue of making sustainable toilets for developing countries, for example porter loos. However, our market research has shown that our product - REPEET – offers something unique and that there is a real demand for our product.


                      Primarily, because we have aimed our product at LICs, the product would have to be affordable. REPEET toilets are only made of plastic (main body, tripod, pipes) and cardboard (disposable boxes for waste) resulting in them having a very light mass which means cheaper shipping costs. It would cost a lot more money shipping porter loos to Bangladesh or Syria, for example, than it would to ship REPEET toilets there. This makes REPEET toilets a better choice than many other solutions.


                      Another reason REPEET toilets are the most practical solution to the problem of un-sustainable sewage systems in many countries, is that instead of just using them for one use, you can in fact use REPEET toilets for three different uses: toilets, soil and showering/clean water. This actually makes this product not just a solution in providing people with a place to relieve themselves but a place to wash instead of the river and a way to produce fertile soil which in turn will help to grow food. It is also all recyclable!



                      In the conditions of people pooing and weeing in holes in the ground, then pouring it into the river and then drinking and washing in that same river water, there are high chances of getting infections which can then lead to diseases. By introducing the REPEET sewage system it will reduce the chances of infections by a great percentage which will make whole areas safer, more hygienic and nicer to live in. We are also hoping that making private areas for people to ‘do their business’ will help girls feel more secure and less vulnerable to sexual predators.




                      REPEET sewage system will help these LIC’s develop and help the people live a happier, cleaner and safer life. It will provide them with private places to go to the toilet, growing spaces and showers. REPEET toilets will ensure that infections and diseases will be reduced areas will be nicer places to be in.

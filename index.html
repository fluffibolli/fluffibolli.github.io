              In many developing countries, the inhabitants are forced to relieve
              themselves in germ-infested rivers near by. They are forced to do
              this because they have no other alternative, such as clean, running
              water.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same river that they relieve themselves in is the one that
              they also drink from and wash in. Consequently, diseases can be
              easily passed from family to family and the underlying reason would
              be that the water that they drink from is polluted with solid and
              liquid waste.
              Due to the severe lack of health care in these regions, illness
              and virus caused by bad hygiene can lead to fatal consequences.
            </p>

              Our product is an attempt to help solve this major issue that costs
              many lives. We are trying to work towards manufacturing a 'sustainable
              toilet for developing countries.'

              Since we started working on this project, our idea has developed
              a huge amount; going from wind turbines all the way to a solution to
              insure hygienic waste disposal in low income countries. Over the
              design process, we have altered and developed our idea so that it is
              the best that it can be.
            </p>
            <p>
              We started with a turbine that generated
              electricity to power house-hold appliances. Then we came up with a
              potable latrine that the people of poverty stricken countries and
              areas could carry around with them. Whilst the wheels of this cart
              turned, the water flushed out all waste. We stuck with the toilet
              theme and finally concluded that this idea would be the most effective.
